# I've Read This

An example plugin developed to demonstrate how to include Ajax operations in the frontend of WordPress.

For users who are logged in, the plugin will display a checkbox at the bottom of each post that will allow them to mark a post as read. If the post has been marked as read, the user will simply see a label noting such.
